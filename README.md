Instagram generates massive amounts of data daily, and content creators rely on engagement metrics to optimize their posts. This project analyzes Instagram data to uncover patterns in reach and interaction, helping creators understand which content performs best.
Using real engagement data, we examine key metrics such as impressions, reach sources (Home, Hashtags, Explore, etc.), saves, comments, shares, likes, profile visits, and follows.

The goal is to analyze and predict post reach to gain insights into Instagramâ€™s algorithm and engagement trends. By leveraging Python, Pandas, and data visualization, this project provides actionable insights for content creators.
